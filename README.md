Probability of Default Credit Risk Model

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the probability of default for credit risk assessment. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification techniques using supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. It utilizes borrower data (e.g., Debt Ratio, Monthly Income, Number of Dependents) to identify high-risk individuals. The notebook guides through loading data, running exploratory data analysis, training models, and evaluating performance with metrics like Accuracy and ROC-AUC. Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the notebook to explore the results and customize the model.
